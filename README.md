Kohana 3.3 Pagination
---

This is hacked up to support Kohana 3.3 (originally Kohana 3.2)  so there are a few things to note:

- changed filenames to work with Kohana 3.3

At previous version (Kohana 3.2):

- Request, Route and route parameters dependency injection added
- URL::query() has been removed, Pagination::query() added instead (HMVC support)
